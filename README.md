# Time Controlled Switch for Electronic Devices


## November, 2025

## Abstract

## 1.15 The Time-Controlled Switch for Electronic Devices is an automated system designed

## to control the switching (ON/OFF) of electrical loads based on user-defined time intervals.

## The project uses an Arduino Uno as the main controller, a 16×2 LCD for real-time display,

## push-button switches for user inputs, a relay module for controlling AC loads, and discrete

## resistors for signal conditioning. A 5V DC adapter is used to power the control circuitry,

## and a light bulb is used as the demonstration load. The system allows the user to

## set ON and OFF durations with precision, providing an efficient and safe method of

## automating appliances. This project is useful in energy conservation, automation, and

## timed operation of household and industrial devices.

### 6.3 Real-Life Applications

- Automatic switching of household lights and fans.
- Water pump or motor automation.
- Egg incubator heating cycle control.
- Agricultural irrigation scheduling.
- Industrial machine cycle timing.
- Automatic battery charging cut-off.
- Aquarium light and aerator timers.

## 7 Conclusion

### The digital ON/OFF timer relay system using Arduino successfully automates the con-

### trol of electrical loads based on user-defined timing settings. By integrating an LCD

### display, push-button interface, and relay module, the system offers a reliable and efficient

### solution for applications where precise timing and automation are required. The project

### demonstrates how microcontrollers can simplify routine tasks, improve safety, and re-

### duce manual intervention. Overall, the design is cost-effective, easy to implement, and

### can be upgraded further with additional features such as real-time clocks, advanced user

### interfaces, and remote monitoring.
